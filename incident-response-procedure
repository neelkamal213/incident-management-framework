# Incident Response Procedure

## Purpose
To provide a standardized approach for detecting, responding to, and resolving IT incidents to minimize business impact and restore normal operations quickly.

## Scope
This procedure applies to all IT incidents affecting services, systems, or users within the organization.

## Roles & Responsibilities

### Incident Manager
- Overall incident coordination
- Stakeholder communication
- Resource allocation
- Post-incident review facilitation

### Service Desk Agent
- Incident logging and categorization
- Initial triage and assessment
- User communication
- Documentation

### Technical Team
- Investigation and diagnosis
- Resolution implementation
- Technical documentation

## Incident Lifecycle

### 1. Detection & Logging (0-5 minutes)
**Trigger**: User report, monitoring alert, or automated detection

**Actions**:
- Log incident in ticketing system
- Assign unique incident ID
- Record date/time, reporter, and initial description
- Classify severity based on impact and urgency

**Outputs**: Incident ticket created

### 2. Categorization & Prioritization (5-10 minutes)
**Actions**:
- Determine incident category (Hardware, Software, Network, etc.)
- Assess business impact (number of users, critical services)
- Assign priority level (P1-P4)
- Identify affected configuration items (CIs)

**Priority Matrix**:
| Impact ↓ / Urgency → | High | Medium | Low |
|---------------------|------|--------|-----|
| **Critical** | P1 | P1 | P2 |
| **High** | P1 | P2 | P3 |
| **Medium** | P2 | P3 | P4 |
| **Low** | P3 | P4 | P4 |

### 3. Investigation & Diagnosis
**Actions**:
- Gather additional information
- Review similar past incidents
- Check monitoring systems and logs
- Identify root cause (if possible)
- Determine resolution approach

**Tools**:
- Monitoring dashboards
- Log analysis tools
- Knowledge base
- Configuration management database (CMDB)

### 4. Resolution & Recovery
**Actions**:
- Implement resolution/workaround
- Test to confirm service restoration
- Verify user access and functionality
- Document resolution steps taken

**For P1/P2 Incidents**:
- Implement workaround first (if available)
- Then address permanent fix
- Keep stakeholders updated every 30-60 minutes

### 5. Closure
**Actions**:
- Confirm with user that issue is resolved
- Complete all incident documentation
- Update knowledge base if needed
- Close incident ticket
- Schedule PIR for P1/P2 incidents

**Quality Checks**:
- [ ] Resolution documented clearly
- [ ] Root cause identified
- [ ] User confirmed resolution
- [ ] Knowledge base updated
- [ ] SLA met or variance explained

## Communication Requirements

### P1 - Critical Incidents
- **Initial notification**: Within 15 minutes to all stakeholders
- **Updates**: Every 30 minutes until resolved
- **Channels**: Email, SMS, conference bridge
- **Stakeholders**: Executive team, affected business units, IT leadership

### P2 - High Priority
- **Initial notification**: Within 1 hour
- **Updates**: Every 2 hours
- **Channels**: Email, team chat
- **Stakeholders**: Affected business units, IT management

### P3/P4 - Medium/Low Priority
- **Updates**: As needed or upon resolution
- **Channels**: Email, ticket updates
- **Stakeholders**: Requestor, assigned team

## Escalation Triggers
- SLA breach imminent (80% of time elapsed)
- Resolution unclear or requires additional expertise
- Multiple systems affected
- Workaround not available
- Management visibility required

## Metrics & Reporting
- Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)
- Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)
- Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR)
- First Call Resolution Rate
- SLA Compliance %
- Incident Volume by Category
- Repeat Incident Rate

## Continuous Improvement
- Monthly incident trend analysis
- Quarterly procedure review
- Regular team training
- Post-incident reviews for major incidents
- Knowledge base maintenance
